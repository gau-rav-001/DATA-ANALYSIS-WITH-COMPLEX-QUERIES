Advanced SQL Data Analysis with Window Functions, Subqueries & CTEs
This project showcases the use of advanced SQL techniques such as window functions, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs) to extract meaningful trends and insights from structured employee data. These powerful SQL features go beyond basic SELECT statements and enable in-depth data analysis, such as ranking, aggregation, and filtering within partitions of data.

üìã Dataset Overview
The sample dataset used includes an Employees table, containing fields like:

EmpID (Employee ID)

EmpName (Employee Name)

DeptID (Department ID)

Salary (Annual Salary)

JoiningDate (Date of Joining)

The table is populated with mock data representing employees from multiple departments with varying salaries and join dates.

üîç SQL Techniques Applied
Window Functions

Used to calculate running averages, rankings, and to identify specific row positions within a partition (e.g., newest employee in each department).

Functions like RANK(), AVG() OVER, and ROW_NUMBER() were applied to evaluate employee performance and departmental comparisons.

Subqueries

Implemented to calculate department-wise salary statistics and filter top departments based on average salary.

Allows breaking down problems into nested logical steps and isolating temporary result sets for further analysis.

CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Used to structure complex queries in a readable and reusable way.

Example: Filtering employees earning above their department's average salary by first calculating departmental averages in a CTE.
